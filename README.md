## this is my first webpage
Welcome

this is my first website which i am just trying to get the hang of using reposortories
the website consists of 3 pages 2 of which have images which acts as links to wikipedia pages around the image

Well a good README.md file has a link to the live deployed project.

It helps the reader to understand what the project does,
what technologies have been used, 
what features you'd like to add,
and it also gives credit for any code that's been taken from other places such as libraries 
that you might have imported,or code you found on StackOverflow.
